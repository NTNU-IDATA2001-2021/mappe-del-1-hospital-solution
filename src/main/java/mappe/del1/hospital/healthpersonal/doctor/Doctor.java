   * implemented the setDiagnoses()-method fully in this class. Then we would
   * not have to override it in the sub classes. On the other hand, we might
   * think that depending upon type of Doctor (defined by a subclass), the
   * types of diagnosis a specialist can- or are allowed to set on a pasient
   * might differ. Hence by leaving this method abstract, we open up for the
   * possibillity for the subclasses to add extra logic to control that
   * a specialized doctor does not set a diagnosis he/she is not allowed to set.
